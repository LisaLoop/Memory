##Project Workflow 
**√ Commit History** 15 commits - 9/6 to 9/11 - Great!   

**X Task Management / Prioritization**  I would have liked to see more effort on CRUD and creating a 2+ model before setting up modal, navbar, etc.   

**X Achieved MVP** Did not achieve MVP (no Models or Ajax routes)  


##Code Quality 
**X Cleanliness** Some unused code commented out   

**√ Indentation** Good indentation   

**√ Clear Names & Comments** variables were aptly named, in-line comments aplenty, but were sometimes cryptic, but did make sense to a developer   

**√ Consistent Style** Style was a little all over the place (app.js vs index.js) but were consistent among each file  


##Models 
**X 2+ Models** model: User  

**X Relationships**  No relationships   


##Routes 
**X RESTful API** No ajax -> express routes  

**√ C** Signup User  

**√ R** Used Provided Read User   

**X U** No Update User   

**X D** No Delete User   


##AJAX 
**X  Form submission** none tied to Ajax, used form POST  

**X  Dynamic Updates w/ jQuery** none tied to Ajax   


##Templating 
**√ HTML Strings + jQuery** Tons of appends and jquery magic   

**√ Underscore / EJS** Good use of EJS   


##Auth 
**X Authentication** good use of provided authentication, no session key encryption  

**X Authorization / Protected Routes** No ajax, no protected routes   

##Commentsl
Your game looks awesome and you have great logic in place for matching tiles!  I would like to see two model documents in use (User and Score ,maybe?) and some AJAX calls from your app.js to index.js.  At this point, you haven't reached MVP; with some further work you'll easily achieve this goal.
